# SSE-Final-Project

## 1. Purpose
This project aims to design and develop software to extract public Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) records from the National Vulnerability Database and populate a relational database. Each record must contain the CVE ID, description, published date and modified date, and severity.

## 1.2 Scope

The software will parse, extract, and organize information from publicly available CVE data sources, storing the data in a relational database for efficient retrieval and analysis.

## 1.3 System Overview

The software converter will retrieve CVE records, process the data, and populate a relational database, allowing users to query and manage vulnerabilities effectively.

## 1.4 Key Features

* Automated retrieval of CVE records from public sources
* Parsing and extraction of relevant information
* Storage of data in a relational database
